# Speech2Face
Image synthesis has been a trending task for the AI community in recent years.
Many works have shown the potential of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) 
to deal with tasks such as text or audio to image synthesis.

## Datasets Description
### Speech2Face
* Fbank: 149,354 voice recordings
* VGG_ALL_FRONTAL (Actual Faces): 139,572 face images
### Age Progression
* UTKFace dataset is a large-scale face dataset with long age span (range from 0 to 116 years old).
The dataset consists of over 20,000 face images with annotations of age, gender, and ethnicity.
The images cover large variation in pose, facial expression, illumination, occlusion, resolution,
etc.
